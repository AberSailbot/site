				<p>Since October 2012, with some assistance from members of staff, we have designed, built and programed the boat's systems ourselves. We have dedicated many hours a week of our spare time to this project to be ready in time for the competition. Our team is comprised of four 1st year Computer Scientists, a 2nd year Computer Scientist and a 1st year Physicist.</p>

				<p>So far, as a team, we have learnt a multitude of new skills, including electronics, robotics programming, mechanical engineering, naval architecture, sailing techniques and team-working. All of which will help us in our studies and our future careers.</p>

				<p>In the future we aim to compete in the World Robotics Sailing Championships, being held in Brest, France this September, and ultimately, compete in the Microtransat challenge to cross the Atlantic under autonomous control.</p>

				<p>We would really appreciate it if you could help us by making a donation. Whatever the amount it will help us secure the funding we need to get our team to Boston in order to compete. </p>
