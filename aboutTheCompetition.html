				<p>The Sailbot competition is an annual competition between student teams, we are the only one of the 16 teams competing that are entering from outside of the US and Canada. Among the other competing teams are the US Naval Academy and the University of British Columbia. Sailing robots need a variety of skills from computer science, naval architecture, and engineering in order to be successful. They have a wide variety of applications such as pollution monitoring, marine biology and border surveillance.</p>

				<p>This year Sailbot is being held in the city of Gloucester, near Boston, Massachusetts, in June 2013.</p>
