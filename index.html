			<p>The Aber SailBot team is made up of a group of students from Aberystwyth University, we all have an interest in an autonomous sailing robot competition, Sailbot, this year held near Boston, Massachusetts, USA, in June 2013.

The Sailbot competition is an annual competition between student teams, we are the only one of the 16 teams competing that are entering from outside of the US and Canada. Among the other competing teams are the US Naval Academy and the University of British Columbia. Sailing robots need a variety of skills from computer science, naval architecture, and engineering in order to be successful. They have a wide variety of applications such as pollution monitoring, marine biology and border surveillance.

Our entry this year is a 1.3 meter long custom built fiberglass boat. It uses a combination of an electronic compass, a GPS receiver and a wind sensor to detect its orientation, position and the wind direction. These are connected to a Raspberry Pi, which is a cheap single board ARM based computer, running Linux, and an Arduino Uno micro-controller board. The sail is controlled by an electronic winch and the rudder by a servo motor, both controlled by the Arduino.

Since October 2012, with some assistance from members of staff, we have designed, built and programed the boat's systems ourselves. We have dedicated many hours a week of our spare time to this project to be ready in time for the competition. Our team is comprised of four 1st year Computer Scientists, a 2nd year Computer Scientist and a 1st year Physicist.

So far, as a team, we have learnt a multitude of new skills, including electronics, robotics programming, mechanical engineering, naval architecture, sailing techniques and team-working. All of which will help us in our studies and our future careers.

In the future we aim to compete in the World Robotics Sailing Championships, being held in Brest, France this September, and ultimately, compete in the Microtransat challenge to cross the Atlantic under autonomous control.

We would really appreciate it if you could help us by making a donation. Whatever the amount it will help us secure the funding we need to get our team to Boston in order to compete. </p>
