				<h2>Welcome To AberSailbot's Sailbot2013 Site!</h2>
				<p>We've been working on our entry to Sailbot2013 since October last year, and it's almost ready to go, but now we need the money to actually get the boat, and our team out to the USA to compete, and we'd love for you to help us get there!</p>

						<p>Today the first thing we did was we decided that we should replace all of our chocolate block connectors with a slightly more permanent, half solderred, half removable design of board, so we started work on soldering them together and adding them into the boat. We also rewired the multiplexor to draw it's power from the servo's instead of the main power distribution board. Lastly we calculated how much money we will need for the trip, and started focussing our efforts on getting sponsors.</p>

We also scheduled our first RC test for March 17th, and discovered a slight sail winch tension issue which was, when the sail is put under load, tension can be lost in the system causing the rigging line to fall off the Sail Winch. We also secured the Arduino mouting to the raspberry pi.</p>

						<p>We also wired up the wind sensor, epoxied in the compass, and threaded the sail winch tentioning bungee into the rig.</p>

We checked the python and arduino code for reasons, but it all seemed fine, and worked out eventually that it was an issue with the connection to the compass, or the compass itself. We also layed out the electronics wiring.</p>

						Yet Another Really Busy Day
					</div>
					<div class="postContent">
						<p>Today, once again, we had a really productive day. We drilled all of the waterproof connector holes, and fitted all but 2 of the connectors because the delivery hasn't come yet. We added an LED to the power ditribution board so that we can see when it's on better. We also considered putting a waterproof switch outside of the boxes to make it easier to turn the power on and off. Louis tested and rewrote the GPS code to make it more effiecient and less buggy. We cabled the XBee box up to the main box.</p>
<p>Importantly we tested the sail winch and rudder servo with the RC remote, which showed we were getting an abnormal amount of interpherance in the connection. We diagnosed the problem as either radio interpherence from the room, power interpherance from the regulators/batteries, which could be fixed by some bigger resistors, or inteference down the cable attaching the servo's to the other boxes, which can be fixed by shortening the cable.</p>

						<p>Today was another day that we seemed to do an aweful lot. First we realised that the GPS was wired incorreclty, and fixed then tested that. Then we removed the Ground wires from the power distribution board (as it will be common ground out of the battery box and split later once it is in the main box). We also put the first waterproof connector into the battery box, built a new heat-sync for the 5v regulator on the power distribution board (because we realised how hot it was getting) and finnally we installed the new Sail Winch and waterproof rudder servo into the deck.</p>

Louis also made the perspex mounting for the Arduino to the Pi, and the mouting for the Compass into the boat. We epoxied the compass into it's container (almost blowing it up in the process because of the heat), and attached it to it's mounting. Decided on and ordered which waterproof connectors to use, and also the new, fully waterproof rudder servo arrived.</p>
